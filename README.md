As the name implies, `creating a school schedual should be simple`.
As a Concordia student in Computer science, I spend a lot of time thinking what courses I should take, what pre-reqs am I missing and more.

âœ…This webpage is meant to:
-   Provide Concordia students the ability to view **pre-reqs**,**co-reqs** & **the amount of credits** of a given course by **name** or **course number**
-  Contact me for any new ideas and feedback :)


ðŸš€Future features:


- Create an alogirthm that will show a sequence of possible classes to take.
Meaning, instead of searching for a course. You will be given suggestions. 
I will take in consideration that not every course is given during a full year. I will also consider if you want to take summer classes. 
And how many classes would you like to take.
